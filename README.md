# Auric

We are living through a crisis of information. In an era where verifying facts is more critical than ever, the tools available to journalists are surprisingly fragile. A typical investigation lives across scattered documents, disparate email threads, and mental notes. This fragmentation isn't just a logistical headache; it is a liability. It makes it harder to verify sources, easier to lose track of evidence, and significantly more difficult for new journalists to produce rigorous work.

Auric was built to address this disconnect. Our goal is to solve two fundamental problems: the high barrier to entry for complex reporting, and the urgent need for structural integrity in journalism.

First, we want to democratize the investigative process. By providing a dedicated "operating system" for investigations, we give independent journalists and small teams the kind of organizational firepower usually reserved for major newsrooms. You don't need to invent a workflow from scratch; Auric gives you a proven structure to build upon.

Second, we believe that organized information is the best defense against misinformation. When you can trace every sentence in your draft back to a specific interview, a saved research query, or a verified contact, you build accountability directly into your writing process. Auric links your sources to your stories and your notes to your drafts, creating a chain of custody for your facts.

## How it works

The application creates a unified environment for the entire lifecycle of a story:

*   **Stories & Research**: Instead of drowning in browser tabs, you save and categorize your research directly against the story it belongs to. This builds a searchable knowledge base rather than a temporary pile of links.
*   **Source Integrity**: Manage your network of sources with clarity. Know exactly who they are, where they work, and which stories they have contributed to.
*   **Structured Outreach**: Draft emails and prepare interview questions within the same context as your research, ensuring you ask the right questions to the right people.
*   **Verifiable Drafting**: Write your articles with all your evidence visible in the sidebar. This encourages referencing your source material constantly, reducing the risk of errors slipping into the final text.
